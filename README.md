# Reef_Nassau_Grouper_Conservation
The Reef-Nassau Grouper Conservation Project by REEF seeks to use AI to identify and monitor the endangered Nassau grouper. Analyzing videos from the Grouper Moon Project, the system captures clear images of individual fish, matching recurring appearances. This aids in better population estimates and bolsters conservation.
